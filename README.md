Hello, my name is mandi (they/them) and I'm a full-stack engineer with great attention to detail and accessibility focus. Over the past year I've made the move to a tech career after previously studying architecture and Spanish, teaching English abroad in South Korea, and working as a disability case manager. I'm passionate about accessibility, love learning new things, and find joy in reading & writing. I believe that technology is meant to improve our lives and bring us together, so let me know if you'd like to work on any projects together!
